# 🏬 Indoor Navigation App Using AI

## 📌 Overview
The **Indoor Navigation App** is an AI-based application designed to help users navigate easily inside large shopping malls. Unlike GPS, which works poorly indoors, this system provides accurate indoor directions to shops, facilities, and points of interest within a mall.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Navigating inside large malls can be confusing due to multiple floors, similar-looking corridors, and lack of clear directions. Traditional GPS systems are ineffective indoors. This project addresses this challenge by providing a smart indoor navigation solution using AI techniques.

## 💡 Solution
The application uses **AI-based pathfinding and indoor mapping** to guide users from their current location to a desired destination inside the mall. It improves user experience by reducing confusion and saving time.

## ✨ Features
- 📍 Indoor location tracking  
- 🧭 Shortest path navigation inside the mall  
- 🏪 Shop and facility identification (stores, restrooms, exits, food courts)  
- 🧠 AI-based decision-making for route optimization  
- 📱 User-friendly interface  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **AI / Algorithms:** Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., graph-based navigation)  
- **Frontend:** (Mention if applicable – Web / Mobile UI)  
- **Backend:** Python-based logic  
- **Tools:** GitHub, IDE (VS Code / PyCharm)
